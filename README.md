# Build Your First 2D Game with Godot 4 - CodeMash 2025

Listed below are the tools and art assets necessary for completing this session.

Once you've downloaded Godot and the art assets, you are ready to go! There are no additional build steps or setup requirements beyond downloading.

## 1 - Download Godot Engine (version 4.3)
Download Godot for free at: https://godotengine.org/download

Godot is also available on Steam. Using Godot through Steam is not recommended approach as Steam will push automatic Major version updates, of which may not be backward compatible with your current version.

## 2 - Download Art & Audio Assets
This repo contains an ArtAssets and AudioAssets folder, each containing some zip files for the sounds and graphics that we will be using to create our game. All assets are CC0 and totally free to use.

For your reference, the resources.txt file at the root of this repo contains links to itch.io where each asset was downloaded.

You will also want to download the PixelDash.ttf font file for UI work later in the workshop.

## 3 (Optional) - Grab the Slides!
This is a lengthy workshop with detailed step-by-step slides identifying what we're doing at each step and why. Be warned; the slides are chonky!
